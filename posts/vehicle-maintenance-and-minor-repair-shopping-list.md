title: "Vehicle Maintenance and Minor Repair Shopping List"

I’ve been wanting to take greater ownership of my vehicle maintenance for years, so I finally bought a Chilton manual for my Tacoma. In the opening pages there’s an extensive list of tools recommended for someone like me: not much experience, but wanting to take care of minor maintenance and repairs by myself. I’ve never really had the opportunity to learn from anyone on a consistent basis, so finally having a guide that shows both what tools I need and how to perform the tasks is something I’m very excited about.

Below I’ve compiled links to each of the recommended tools and their prices. With the prices listed below, the entire set comes out to around $460. And if, like me, you’ve always been the kind of person who takes their car to the dealership for routine maintenance, this entire set will have paid for itself after something like six oil changes. But, when you take into account the vast array of maintenance you’ll be able to perform with these tools (the ones necessary for the oil change only account for about $20 of it), you could pretty well assume a measurable ROI long before that sixth oil change.

Please note, all of these prices are what they were when I started writing this, so they’ve probably changed. I have no preference for auto supply stores, O’Reilly just happens to be the closest to where I live. I also dig that Lowes granted $25M to re-opening minority-owned businesses during COVID-19, so I’ve preferred to link to their product lines when no specialty option was obvious.
