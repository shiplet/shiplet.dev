# Thoughts on Ikenfell

I've never written a game review before and I'm not a gaming journalist, so I make no apologies for whether or not this focuses on the things people consider to be important when reading a video game review. I'm going to focus on the things that I loved about the game, and try not to ruin it for anybody who might have an interest in playing.

My favorite thing about Ikenfell isn't necessarily the combat system, the music, the story, or the characters. It's honestly all of those things. The game is written with such a nuanced, delicate, and dedicated awareness of and approach to trauma, that it's hard to complete it without feeling like you just took some time to heal a bunch of little broken parts of yourself, or like the good cries you have throughout the game were just a little more poignant and purposeful than "this is an emotional part of the story."

It's cathartic for sure. I completed the game about 15 minutes before writing this, but I suspect I'll carry the emotional salve of its conclusion for longer than most games I've played. It's also challenging, even though the settings have an option where you can literally insta-win any battle you want.
