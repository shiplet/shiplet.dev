- If your session is too quiet, turn up your speakers
- If your session is too loud, turn down your tracks
- In a digital recording setup, you get no benefit from nearly clipping the audio - the quality of the audio is the same if you're in the middle of the master range
- Record at a conservative level
- Set your volume knob at a spot and stick with that spot for every project
- At the beginning of the mixing process, use the trim knobs rather than the faders, because the faders are logarithmic. If you have to cut a track by 29dB, that puts you in a range on the faders where for every microadjustment you make, you're potentially swinging 10dB in any direction. If you kick of the mix with the trim knobs first, you can get close enough to your final mixing volume, that you still have the resolution available in the fader, which is still zeroed out at this point.
- Set your levels first and THEN bring in plugins to fix problems
- It's like setting the z-index and positioning of all the elements of the song, or interior decorating.
