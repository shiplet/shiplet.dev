<p><strong>Apache</strong> - chiefly, an organization of open source software applications; commonly refers to the popular open source, configurable web server, written in C, and distributed by default with many operating systems</p>



<p><strong>apt </strong>- the standard Debian/Ubuntu package manager. Like npm/yarn, but for the Ubuntu flavor of Linux distributions.</p>



<p><strong>cluster -</strong> a grouping of containers typically managed by a single, central node, and situated behind a load balancer</p>



<p><strong>container -</strong> a lightweight abstraction of a server,  process, system architecture, program, or other software; typically  relies on the host machineâ€™s native resources directly, rather than through a layer of hardware emulation as in a virtual machine</p>



<p><strong>database</strong> <strong>-</strong> an arbitrary collection of data and data relationships, based on models/archetypes defined by the user; can be arranged by columns, rows, and tables, or by objects and blobs; data can be accessed via predefined relationships (relational), or directly by object/object type (non-relational); accessed via unique query languages which tend to identify both the language and the database, e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc...</p>



<p><strong>DNS</strong> <strong>-</strong> the Domain Name System; the global directory &amp; mapping of domain names and their respective IP addresses; is also used to collectively refer to things involved with the registration, routing, and subrouting of domain names</p>


<p id="gped"><strong>Game Physics Engine Development (GPED) </strong>- the educational text upon which Coma Physics is based. Written by Ian Millington.</p>


<p><strong>HTTP accelerator -</strong> a server that acts as a  high-level cache, and which is based on individual HTTP requests, often  storing a plaintext response based on a prior response from the  application server; intercepts HTTP requests and returns these plaintext responses before the application server ever needs to spin up</p>



<p><strong>Linux</strong> - an open source operating system widely used for applications ranging from the web to mobile to embedded devices, see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)">Wikipedia</a></p>



<p><strong>load balancer</strong> <strong>-</strong> a server that acts as a broker for  incoming requests and their intended destination, and which uses one or a  combination of algorithms to determine which destination application server is  currently best suited to handling the request/response</p>



<p><strong>logging -</strong> standardized messages sent to either a file or a remote service, organized by level of severity (debug, info, warning, error/exception, fatal)</p>



<p><strong>Nginx </strong>- a popular, configurable, performant web server, written in C; frequently used in applications requiring reverse-proxies</p>



<p><strong>reverse-proxy</strong> - a server positioned in front of subsequent web servers, which primarily serves to forward incoming requests and data appropriately</p>



<p><strong>server - </strong>either a machine or a process that allows for the programmatic handling of inputs and outputs</p>



<p><strong>SSL</strong> <strong>-</strong> Secure Sockets Layer; see also <strong>TLS</strong> (transport layer security); a cryptographic layer of security for HTTP requests, now deprecated</p>



<p><strong>TLS</strong> <strong>-</strong> Transport Layer Security; the currently used protocol for cryptographically securing HTTP requests</p>



<p><strong>Unix </strong>- one of the original standardized operating systems, originally developed at Bell Labs; focusing primarily on a filesystem shared between permission-bound users; adheres to the principle that "everything is a file"</p>
