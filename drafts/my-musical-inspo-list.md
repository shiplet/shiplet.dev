# This is a work-in-progress. I'm still converting it from HTML to MD

<p>This is a list of artists who've influenced me in major ways. Also, one thing I've noticed as I've gone through collecting bandcamps and sites - a LOT of official sites have either a broken or no SSL cert. If any of the groups on this list happen upon this post and are looking for someone to build a site, hit me up.</p>
